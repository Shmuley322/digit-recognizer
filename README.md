This project is a showcase of my ability to build a multi-layer perceptron from scratch (using only numpy). The neural net that I created should be viewed only as a proof of concept and a display of my understanding of how MLPs work. 

Here is a quick layout of the notebook:

- I first take a dataset from the Digit Recognizer Kaggle challenge (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer) and use the neural network I created to make a submission and get an evaluation
- Then I create an image classifier using the FastAI library to make the second submission
- After that I will compare the results and discuss the problems of the network designed by me (using the fashion_mnist dataset as an illustration)
